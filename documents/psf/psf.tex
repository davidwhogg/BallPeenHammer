\title{The \HST\ \WFC\ IR-channel point-spread function}
\author{Ross Fadely \& David W. Hogg}

\begin{abstract}
Accurate point-source photometry and astrometry depends on an accurate model of the point-spread function (PSF).
The publicly available models for the PSF in the \HST\ \WFC\ IR-channel instrument are not accurate.
Here we construct an empirical model of this PSF,
  using archival observations of compact sources taken with the instrument.
Our model is of the \emph{pixel-convolved} PSF;
  it is a model for the PSF as it appears in the pixel read-outs of the instrument
  as a function of the sub-pixel position of the source.
We build our model for the XXX, YYY, and ZZZ bandpasses;
  the PSF in other bandpasses can be interpolated from these.
The variation of the PSF with position in the focal plane
  is apparent in the model.
We don't explicitly model the dependence of the PSF on source color,
  but we show that there are effects evident in the data.
All the code is released under an open-source license
  and all the results are presented in machine-readable form.
