Probabilistic Self-Calibration of the WFC3 IR Channel

Abstract:

The scientific output of any instrument hinges upon the quality of its calibration.  Modern astronomical experiments rely on their instruments to be extremely precisely calibrated, and these demands will only worsen with upcoming missions.  Currently, it is unclear whether traditional methods can meet future needs, nor is it clear they will fulfill the current needs of astronomers using HST.  We consider it important to explore new approaches, and propose to do so using archival WFC3 data.  Here, we will apply probabilistic self-calibration of the F110W and F160W filters of the IR channel.  Our method relies on the fact that many simliar astronomical sources (like stars) have flux that touches all parts of the detector.  We can therefore construct a probabilistic model for the sources, deviations from which are due to calibration errors.  In addition, it relies on sensible priors from existing calibration and astronomical knowledge.  Our project will deliver a new, pixel-to-pixel flat field for the two filters - verifying the existing flat (which relies on pre-launch data) and potentially improving the current calibration.  We intend to expand our methods beyond this zero-th goal, and will explore issues like time-varying calibration and persistence.
