Precise calibration of the detector in an astronomical imaging camera
is not trivial---and it is only harder if it is in space.
Fundamentally, the sensitivity of the device must be calibrated with
incident photons; no artificial light source is available; even if an
artificial source \emph{were} available, it could not be designed to
illuminate the device exactly as does a star or other astronomical
source.

The imaging devices of the \HST\ are calibrated by a number of
methods:
\\ $\bullet$ \project{laboratory calibration}: The instrument was illuminated
  in the laboratory pre-flight.  In principle this calibration can be
  done perfectly, but \textsl{(a)}~usually the calibration
  illumination does not illuminate the instrument exactly as does an
  in-flight star observation, and \textsl{(b)}~usually the light
  source does not have a completely appropriate SED.  The laboratory
  calibration happens pre-launch, so changes in the instrument through
  launch and age cannot be captured, nor can some aspects of in-launch
  environment (loading, temperature, pressure).
\\ $\bullet$ \project{standard stars}: On a regular schedule, well-understood
  standard stars are placed in the instrument focal plane to test the
  on-orbit throughput of the device.  These observations are key to
  instrument monitoring, but they don't calibrate the device at the
  pixel level; they provide only overall throughput measurements.
\\ $\bullet$ \project{grid test}: The throughput measurements are transferred
  out to the entire device by grid tests, in which standards or a star
  field are stepped over the instrument focal plane.  This brings the
  same astronomical source to many different focal-plane positions; it
  permits relative calibration of different parts of the detector.
  The grid, however, is not dense at the pixel level.  The grid test
  does not provide a pixel-to-pixel flat field; it only calibrates the
  flat on large scales.
\\ $\bullet$ \project{super-flat}: The only in-flight source of
  pixel-to-pixel sensitivity information are the photons detected in
  the sky---the blank parts of the imaging.  These photons can be
  combined (with masking of detected astronomical sources) into a
  pixel-level sensitivity map.  Unfortunately, this map is a
  sensitivity to the \emph{sky} not to a \emph{star}: The sky has a
  different SED than any star.  More importantly, the
  uniform-brightness sky illuminates the device differently than any
  star.  This problem is a bigger problem for open-structure
  ground-based telescopes than it is for the \HST, but it isn't known
  to be negligible for \HST.

There is no method, not even any \emph{combination of methods} that
can be used to test the calibration of the detector in-flight,
providing information on pixel-to-pixel relative sensitivity (small
scales), illuminating the detector as stars do, and with the SEDs or
colors of astronomical sources of interest.  It is possible that these
things don't matter---that every pixel of every \HST\ instrument is
properly calibrated---but it is close to impossible to know with the
calibration data available at present.  That is, if the flat
appropriate to stellar sources is different at fine (pixel-level)
angular scales from the flat appropriate to sky photons, that problem
would not appear strongly in current calibration data.

\textbf{Here we propose to calibrate the \WFC\ instrument at the pixel
  level using all of the science data availble in \MAST.}
Importantly, we will build this calibration from the astronomical
sources in the data, \emph{not} the blank-sky parts of the imaging.
By construction, the flats we produce will be built from sources with
astrophysically relevant SEDs.

In general there are two approaches for self-calibration of this kind.
The first---what we might call ``traditional'' self-calibration---is
built on the principle that if the \emph{same object} is observed at
\emph{different focal-plane positions} the inferences made ought to be
independent of focal-plane position.  This kind of self-calibration is
most effective when the observatory obeys calibration-oriented
observing strategies (CITE HOLMES), and those strategies involve
multiple observations for most sources.  This approach is not
applicable to most \HST\ instruments, because sources are rarely
observed multiple times, and when they are it is usually on one of a
small number of small-angle dithers.

In the second approach---what we might call ``probabilistic''
self-calibration---the fundamental principle is that no \emph{pixel}
will see a \emph{special set of astronomical objects}.  (Of course
this assumption is wrong in important ways, to which we will return
below.)  This kind of self-calibration is applicable in (almost) any
observing strategy, provided that the imager has been used to make
\emph{an enormous number of observations}.

In a probabilistic self-calibration, the idea is that the probability
distribution function (PDF) for image patches output by any exposure
in any region of the focal plane ought to match well the PDF in any
\emph{other} region of the focal plane.  If the calibration parameters
get set to bad values, the observed image patches will contain
imprints of the calibration errors, related to the location on the
focal plane from which they are taken.  The simplest version of
probabilistic self-calibration is the construction of the
``super-flat'' in the current \WFC\ calibration strategy; the
super-flat is constructed by forcing statistics of the pixel values to
be constant across the device.  The most extreme version of
probabilistic self-calibration would be to construct highly
informative prior PDFs for astronomical images and find the
calibration parameters at which the output images match best those
priors!  Here we propose to do something intermediate.

...instrument these equations with words...
\begin{eqnarray}
p_n &\equiv& p(D_n)
\\
\ln L &=& \sum_n \ln p_n
\\
p_n &\approx& \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{n'\neq n} K([D_n - D_{n'}]^2)
\\
\frac{\dd p_n}{\dd \theta_j} &=& \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{n'\neq n} \left[
  \frac{\dd D_n}{\dd \theta_j}\cdot(D_n - D_{n'})
 -\frac{\dd D_{n'}}{\dd \theta_j}\cdot(D_n - D_{n'})
  \right]\,K'([D_n - D_{n'}]^2)
\end{eqnarray}

...how is the ``no pixel is special'' assumption wrong?..
