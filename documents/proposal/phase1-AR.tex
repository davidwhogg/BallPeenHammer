Precise calibration of the detector in an astronomical imaging camera
is not trivial---and it is only harder if it is in space.
Fundamentally, the sensitivity of the device must be calibrated with
incident photons; no artificial light source is available; even if an
artificial source \emph{were} available, it could not be designed to
illuminate the device exactly as does a star or other astronomical
source.

The imaging devices of the \HST\ are calibrated by a number of
methods:
\\ $\bullet$ \project{laboratory calibration}: The instrument was illuminated
  in the laboratory pre-flight.  In principle this calibration can be
  done perfectly, but \textsl{(a)}~usually the calibration
  illumination does not illuminate the instrument exactly as does an
  in-flight star observation, and \textsl{(b)}~usually the light
  source does not have a completely appropriate SED.  The laboratory
  calibration happens pre-launch, so changes in the instrument through
  launch and age cannot be captured, nor can some aspects of in-launch
  environment (loading, temperature, pressure).
\\ $\bullet$ \project{standard stars}: On a regular schedule, well-understood
  standard stars are placed in the instrument focal plane to test the
  on-orbit throughput of the device.  These observations are key to
  instrument monitoring, but they don't calibrate the device at the
  pixel level; they provide only overall throughput measurements.
\\ $\bullet$ \project{grid test}: The throughput measurements are transferred
  out to the entire device by grid tests, in which standards or a star
  field are stepped over the instrument focal plane.  This brings the
  same astronomical source to many different focal-plane positions; it
  permits relative calibration of different parts of the detector.
  The grid, however, is not dense at the pixel level.  The grid test
  does not provide a pixel-to-pixel flat field; it only calibrates the
  flat on large scales.
\\ $\bullet$ \project{super-flat}: The only in-flight source of
  pixel-to-pixel sensitivity information are the photons detected in
  the sky---the blank parts of the imaging.  These photons can be
  combined (with masking of detected astronomical sources) into a
  pixel-level sensitivity map.  Unfortunately, this map is a
  sensitivity to the \emph{sky} not to a \emph{star}: The sky has a
  different SED than any star.  More importantly, the
  uniform-brightness sky illuminates the device differently than any
  star.  This problem is a bigger problem for open-structure
  ground-based telescopes than it is for the \HST, but it isn't known
  to be negligible for \HST.

There is no method, not even any \emph{combination of methods} that
can be used to test the calibration of the detector in-flight,
providing information on pixel-to-pixel relative sensitivity (small
scales), illuminating the detector as stars do, and with the SEDs or
colors of astronomical sources of interest.  It is possible that these
things don't matter---that every pixel of every \HST\ instrument is
properly calibrated---but it is close to impossible to know with the
calibration data available at present.

\textbf{Here we propose to calibrate the \WFC\ instrument at the pixel
  level using all of the science data availble in \MAST.}
Importantly, we will build this calibration from the astronomical
sources in the data, \emph{not} the blank-sky parts of the imaging.
By construction, the flats we produce will be built from sources with
astrophysically relevant SEDs.

%   3. MANAGEMENT PLAN
%       (see Section 9.7 of the Call for Proposals)
%
%  Provide a concise, but complete, management plan. This plan will be used
%  by the review panels to assess the likely scale of the proposed research
%  program. Proposers should include a schedule of the work required to
%  achieve the scientific goals of the program, a description of the roles of the
%  PI, CoIs, postdocs, and students who will perform the work, and a plan to
%  disseminate the results to the community.
