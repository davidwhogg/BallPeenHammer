\section{Introduction}



\section{Calibration using pixel-convolved psfs}

\subsection{Model}

Our flatfield calibration model relies on the fact that stars look very similar across the 
WFC3 detector, over the lifetime of observations.  Indeed, the WFC3 PSF is very stable --
spatial and temporal variations of the PSF are known to be slowly varying relative to 
the pixel scale and between observations (AK, others).  Due to this fact, we can model 
an observation of a star as a scaled PSF, whose deviations from the model are due to 
errors in the current flatfield.

While an excellent approximation to the true PSF, it is known that TinyTim models for the 
PSF are insufficient for accurate data reconstruction (cites).  For our case, this is particularly 
true since we are looking to improve upon the current WFC3 flatfield which is estimated to 
be accurate to the $\sim1\%$ level.   For these reasons, we deem it necessary to 
allow for a very flexible PSF model that can be learned from the data.  Our PSF model is 
nearly identical to that used to generate ACS `empirical' PSFs in \citet{AK}.  That is, we 
have a 2D grid of values that define the value of the pixel-convolved PSF for any given 
pixel, as a function of the $x$ and $y$ positions relative to the centroid of the star.  In Figure 
\ref{fig:psfdemo} we show how a PSF model for a patch of data is generated from our 2D 
pixel-convolved PSF model.

Our simple model for a star in the F160W data is 

\begin{eqnarray}
M_i = A_i P_i + B_i
\quad , 
\label{eqn:model-noflat}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $M_i$ is the model of  a $5\time5$ patch of the pixel values for star $i$, with the patch 
centered on the brightest pixel.  $A_i$ is a scalar amplitude which we fit for, under the model 
for the PSF $P_i$ at the inferred location of the star's centroid.  Since the patch may contain flux from 
large gradients or nearby sources in the image, we also allow a simple background model 
$B_i = b_i + m_{x, i} \vc{x} + m_{y, i} \vc{y}$.  That is, we consider a background flux model 
which is a additive scalar $b_i$ and a 2D linear gradient.  

The model described by Equation \ref{eqn:model-noflat} would be the appropriate model for 
`well calibrated' data, where we believe a corrections do to flat-fielding, bias, etc. are assumed 
to be correct.  Here, our goal is to improve on the current best estimate of the flat-field by modeling 
the flat-field for a patch as a multiplicative set of pixel values, $F_i$.  Therefore for our purposes 
the model for data patch $D_i$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
M_i = F_i (A_i P_i + B_i)
\quad .
\label{eqn:model-noflat}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Data and Modeling Considerations}

There are many practical considerations which need to be addressed before we can solve 
for the flat-field and PSF in WFC2 F160W image patches.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item First, we need to identify patches in 
the \flt files that contain objects very likely to be stars.  This can be a non-trivial task - as sources 
in the images become fainter, stars and galaxies tend to become more similar.   To identify stars, 
we run \se \citep{Bertin} and the examine measured quantities versus the visual 
appearance of the sources.  We find that using a criterion that the `stellarity' index is greater 0.8, 
along with a requirement that the peak brightness is greater than 25 times the median pixel 
brightness, seems to indicate sources which appear very pointlike: the selected sources are 
unmistakably round, concentrated, and in almost all cases exhibit a faint Airy ring (which lies at 
radii outside our 5 pixel patches).  These are horribly ill justified heuristics, but none-the-less 
seem to suit our purposes.  We have also considered using difference between the peak 
brightness and auto-iron magnitudes produced by \se, as they have been should to 
easily distinguish stars and galaxies in high quality HST data.  We find that for the fainter, lower 
signal to noise sources such a clear division using this criterion is not always possible.  We 
recognize that our heuristic source classification can lead some galaxies falling into our sample, 
we attempt to lessen the effect of such sources using a crude outlier model (see Section \ref{sec:opt} 
below.  Finally, we note that we do not consider sources denoted as blends by \se.  In all, our 
selection criteria yield $\sim1.8$ million patches of point-like sources.

\item We consider the data in the calibrated \flt images to be of vary high quality.  Bias and flat-field 
corrects provided by the STScI pipeline is very close the correct calibration of the data.  We 
therefore assume that \emph{all} calibrations applied to the \flt images are correct, except for the 
flat-field which we aim to improve upon.  We carefully note data quality flags in the \flt files, and 
generally do not use pixels flagged as bad or worrisome by the pipeline.  

\item Persistence is known to be an issue for long exposures or for places where bright sources 
hit the detector.  We have downloaded all the persistence model images from 
MAST\footnote{http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/persist/search.php} which are applicable to our 
images.  For a given patch, we select the corresponding patch in the persistence image, subtract 
it from the data, and add (when used) the persistence value in quadrature to nominal flux 
uncertainty estimate.

\item (NOTE) if we do full detector, we punt on the edges.
\item (NOTE) what do we do about chromaticity

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Optimization}

- how do we proceed?
- what is the outlier model, if any?
- convergence?
- why SQE instead of $\chi^2$?
- initialization?
