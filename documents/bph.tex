\begin{abstract}
In astronomical imaging projects, pixel-level calibration (bias, dark,
and flat) estimated via zero-length exposures and images of an
illuminated dome or twilight sky may not be optimal for application to
the measurements of greatest scientific interest.  Furthermore, in
most present-day experiments, many more photons are collected in the
scientific object data than in the calibration data.  For these
reasons, it makes sense to ask whether the full set of calibration
information could be derived from the science data alone.  In this
\documentname, we build very flexible models of astronomical imaging
based on mixtures of Gaussians (really mixtures of factor analyzers)
and use those models to test and improve pixel-level calibration
parameters.  We demonstrate with real data from the \project{Sloan
  Digital Sky Survey} and the \project{Hubble Space Telescope
  Wide-Field Camera 3} that we can accurately determine calibration
information using only science data.  Our self-calibration method is
computationally expensive, but has the advantages that (by
construction) it infers the parameters that are directly relevant to
the science data, that it captures the large amount of calibration information latent
in the full scientific data set, and that it reduces or obviates
calibration overheads.

\section{Introduction}

...on photometric self-calibration, cite Padmanabhan \etal~20xx, Holmes
\etal~2012.  Note limitation that these methods work at catalog level,
don't calibrate below the resolution of the photometric methodology,
and aren't sensitive to additive problems.

...Notes about flexible models, maybe even citing a previous paper by
Fadely?  It is not clear to Hogg whether these should be separate
papers or the same paper.

\section{Image patch model}

...We need an astronomer-friendly explanation of mixture of factor
analyzers.  Hogg is at your service.
